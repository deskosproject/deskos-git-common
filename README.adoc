= deskos-git-common: Utilities to work with DeskOS Git repos

This git repo contains the following scripts that make interfacing with DeskOS Git repositories as easy as possible.

Tools:

* get_sources.sh: when run from inside a package git checkout, will download the relevant non-text sources from the lookaside cache and drop them into the SOURCES/ dir; note: it will generate 0 byte files in place, rather than download them.

* into_srpm.sh: Builds the SRPM.
